## Contents
- `dataset/`: Contains the Uber dataset files obtained from Kaggle.
- `power_bi_analysis.pbix`: The Power BI file containing the analysis, data cleaning, and visualizations.
- `presentation.pptx`: The PowerPoint presentation summarizing the analysis findings and recommendations.

## Results and Insights
The analysis using Power BI revealed several key insights:
- There is a significant demand for Uber services during morning and evening rush hours, leading to potential supply-demand gaps during these periods.
- The analysis identified specific areas, such as Airport pickup points, where car availability and customer experience need improvement.
- Customer feedback and ratings highlighted areas for improvement in terms of driver behavior, wait times, and overall service quality.

## Future Optimizations
- Implement real-time data integration to monitor car availability and demand patterns for more accurate resource allocation.
- Leverage advanced analytics techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, to forecast demand and optimize operations in real-time.
- Conduct regular surveys and feedback collection to track customer satisfaction and identify areas for continuous improvement.
